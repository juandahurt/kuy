# Kuy

This is a simple (I suppose) Game Engine, following the course [CS4300 - C++ Game Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7lXSihz0ac&list=PL_xRyXins848nDj2v-TJYahzvs-XW9sVV). It uses SFML to avoid the usage of OpenGL/Metal/etc.

There are tons of things in my mind to do with this project. But, realistically speaking:
- I would like to make some simple games with it and add them to the project as "Examples". 
- A nice folder structure.
- Improve the components architecture (maybe another way of getting them and adding them (?))
- Make it really easy to use.
- Maaaybe a 2d map editor.

That's it.
